Pedofit is a simple application that tracks the biweekly step count. It fetches the daily step count data and displays this information in scrollable cardviews with a single day's worth of total steps per card view. Only the last two weeks worth of steps are considered.

The app also has the capability to toggle the order of the list between chronological and reverse chronological.

This app makes use of Google Fit, which is a platform that allows the developers to build applications that are focused on user's fitness data.
